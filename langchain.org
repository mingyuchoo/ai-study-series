**** 한계점 해결책
1. Fine-tuning
2. N-short Learning
3. In-context Learning
*** Components
1. LLM (Language Models):
   These are the core models that process natunal langauge, such as OpenAI's GPT, which LangChain interacts with.
2. Prompt Templates:
   A way to structure and format prompts sent to the language models, ensuring consistent interaction.
3. Chain:
   LangChain provides the ability to link together various components (models, APIs, functions) into a chain of operations that can automate complex tasks.
4. Agents:
   These components allow the model to take actions and make decisions, often involving interaction with other tools or APIs.
5. Memory:
   LangChain supports memory to store and retrieve information across sessions, allowing more personalized and coherent long-term interactions.
6. Data Connectors:
   LangChain provides integrations with databases, APIs, and other data soruces to facilitate access to external information.
7. Tools and APIs:
   LangChain can be extended with external tools, allowing language models to interact with code, databases, and more.
